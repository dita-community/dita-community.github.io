    <h1>DITA Community Activity</h1>
    <p>The DITA Community Github organization serves the DITA community
by providing a place for things like Open Toolkit plugins, sample content,
or other utilities that don't have a better home. See the 
<a href="http://github.com/dita-community">main Github
DITA Community page</a> for the list of projects. Each project should have
      a readme file and may have its own project Web page or wiki.
    </p>
    <p>If you would like to contribute a project to the DITA Community activity,
    contact any of the people listed as owners of the DITA Community Github
    organization.</p>
